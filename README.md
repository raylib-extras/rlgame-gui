# rlgame-GUI
Work In Progress Resolution independent gui for raylib.

rlgame-GUI is designed as a simple screen based UI for in game HUDs panels and menus. It is not designed as a windowing system, or for use as an editor (DearImGui is much better for that). rlgame-GUI works by defining nested UI elements that are anchored to parts of the screen in a resolution indepdnent manner.

## Building
rlgame-GUI is setup to use premake by default. Simply run the batch file or premake command for your platform and it will generate a project or makefile. If you don't want to use premake, simply add all the code in rlgamegui to your game project
